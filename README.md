üî≠ About The Project
We will work on different models:
‚óè Naive Bayes
‚óè K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
‚óè Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
‚óè Decision Tree
‚óè Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
‚óè SVM


‚ö° Metrics definition 
To evaluate the performance of our models, we will compare some metrics : 
‚óè Accuracy: It is defined as the number of correct predictions made by the 
model divided by the total number of predictions made. It is a measure of the 
overall correctness of the model's predictions.
‚óè Precision: It is defined as the proportion of predicted positive cases that are 
actually positive. It is a measure of the model's exactness or how many of the 
positive predictions are true.
‚óè Recall: It is defined as the proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly 
identified by the model. It is a measure of the model's completeness or how 
many of the positive cases are identified.
‚óè F1-score: It is a harmonic mean of precision and recall and is a balanced 
measure that combines both precision and recall. It is defined as F1-score = 2 
x (precision x recall) / (precision + recall). It provides a single score that 
balances both precision and recall
